# üöÄ Sales Analysis Dashboard | Power BI (My First Dashboard Project)

This repository contains my first complete, end-to-end data analysis project using **Power BI Desktop**. This initiative successfully transforms raw transactional data, loaded directly from an Excel/CSV source, into a dynamic, interactive dashboard designed to empower strategic business decisions.

The project demonstrates proficiency in the full data lifecycle: data acquisition, transformation (using Power Query), data modeling, calculating key metrics (using DAX), and final visualization.
